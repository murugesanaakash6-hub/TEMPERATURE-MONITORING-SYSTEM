##The Temperature Monitoring System is designed using an Arduino UNO and a DHT22 temperature sensor and is simulated using the Wokwi online simulator. The DHT22 sensor measures the ambient temperature and sends digital data to the Arduino for processing. The Arduino reads the temperature values and displays them on the Serial Monitor in real time.
In this system, the DHT22 sensor is connected to the Arduino with three connections: VCC to 5V, DATA to digital pin D2, and GND to ground. The Arduino continuously reads the sensor data at regular intervals and converts it into readable temperature values in degrees Celsius. These values are printed on the Serial Monitor, allowing easy observation and monitoring.
The Wokwi simulator provides a virtual environment to test and verify the circuit and code without using physical components. Users can also adjust the temperature values in the simulator to observe changes in real-time output.
This project is simple, cost-effective, and suitable for educational purposes. It demonstrates the basic concepts of sensor interfacing, serial communication, and real-time data monitoring using an embedded system.
